/*
call OTAPI_Wrap::LoadInbox() to load the inbox ledger from local storage.

During this time, your user has the opportunity to peruse the inbox, and to
decide which transactions therein he wishes to accept or reject. Usually the
inbox is displayed on the screen, then the user selects various items to accept
or reject, and then the user clicks “Process Inbox” and then you do this:
Then call OTAPI_Wrap::Ledger_CreateResponse() in order to create a ‘response’
ledger for that inbox, which will be sent to the server to signal your responses
to the various inbox transactions.
Then call OTAPI_Wrap::Ledger_GetCount() (pass it the inbox) to find out how many
transactions are inside of it. Use that count to LOOP through them…
Use OTAPI_Wrap::Ledger_GetTransactionByIndex() to grab each transaction as you
iterate through the inbox. (There are various introspection functions you can
use in the API here if you wish to display the inbox items on the screen for the
user…)
Next call OTAPI_Wrap::Transaction_CreateResponse() for each transaction in the
inbox, to create a response to it, accepting or rejecting it. This function
creates the response and adds it to the response ledger.
Next, call OTAPI_Wrap::Ledger_FinalizeResponse() which will create a Balance
Agreement for the ledger.
Finally, call OTAPI_Wrap::processInbox() to send your message to the server and
process the various items.

If the message was successful, then use
OTAPI_Wrap::Message_GetBalanceAgreementSuccess() and
OTAPI_Wrap::Message_GetTransactionSuccess() as described above in the deposit
cash instructions.

// Done:  add options here for accept transfers, accept receipts, and accept

// Done:  Then basically make a version for the payments inbox for accept
// payments, accept invoices, and accept all.
//
// (Accepting payments can basically be automated, but accepting invoices
// requires user permission.)
//
// Therefore add:
//   acceptmoney    -- This accepts all incoming transfers and incoming payments
//                     (Not receipts or invoices) for any designated accounts
// and nyms.
//   acceptreceipts -- Accepts all inbox receipts (not transfers.)
//   acceptinvoices -- Accepts all invoices (not payments.)
//   acceptall      -- All of the above.
//
// Todo: Make the above functions also work with specific indices (vs "all")
//
